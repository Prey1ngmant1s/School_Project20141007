                <h3>Mutualism</h3>
                <img src="" />

                <P>Mutualism is any relationship between individuals of different species where both individuals benefit.
                   In general, only lifelong interactions involving close physical and biochemical contact can properly be considered symbiotic
                    . Mutualistic relationships may be either obligate for both species, obligate for one but facultative for the other, or facultative
                    for both. Many biologists restrict the definition of symbiosis to close mutualist relationships. Symbiosis of this kind come from many animals
                    and other forms of life, Insects have many Mutalistic relatsion with plants but there is no better example than the bee. While the bee gathers nectar
                    it also takes pollen from plants and spreads it allowing the flowers to thrive and the bee to contnue to nest and eat.</P>
                </p>
                <h3>Parasitism</h3>
                <p>A parasitic relationship is one in which one member of the association benefits while the other is harmed. One of the most common is the relation between the
                flee and Mammals when a flee latches on to an animal it begins to draw blood,cause diseases and lay eggs all of which the animl is not benfiting from
                and instead of both species gaining from this only the flee will gain from this relation.</p>
